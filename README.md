University Project in Web and Cloud Applications

The “All You Can Cook” project aims to create a web platform dedicated to managing recipes. The site allows users to search for recipes, register, and manage their profile, creating a personal recipe book containing reviews and personal notes saved for each dish. Through integration with The Meal DB API, the platform provides a wide variety of predefined dishes and ensures that recipe information is always up to date, offering users a comprehensive and constantly updated experience.
